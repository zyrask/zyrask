            <h2>Who is Messiah?</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Messiah</strong>, but online, you can call me <strong>Zy</strong> or <strong>Zyrask</strong>. I'm a passionate game developer, coder, and creator with a love for making projects that work, whether it's building a game or developing web applications. I also enjoy baking, so when I'm not coding, you'll probably catch me whipping up something sweet in the kitchen!</p>
            <p>One of my biggest inspirations is <strong>Lil Uzi Vert</strong> — I'm all about his old tracks, though I don't really vibe with hits like "XO Tour Llif3". When I'm working, I often get into his music for some motivation!</p>
            <p>I'm also a big fan of dogs and prefer working with teams in big projects. I love creating and developing on platforms like Roblox, and I don't just do this for the fun of it; I really get into the coding and design work.</p>

        <div class="tabs">
            <div class="tab" onclick="showTab(1)">My Projects</div>
            <div class="tab" onclick="showTab(2)">Coding & Development</div>
            <div class="tab" onclick="showTab(3)">Baking & Hobbies</div>
        </div>

        <div class="tab-content" id="tab1">
            <h2>My Projects</h2>
            <p>One of the projects I worked on was the Roblox game <strong>Mythical Clash</strong>, which I have since privated for various reasons. It was a passion project, and it got a lot of attention during its run, but I prefer to keep things on the down-low now. I’ve also worked on several game dev projects that never made it to release, including "Galactic Arena" and "Dungeon Quest"—two titles I might revisit in the future, depending on how things go!</p>
            <p>In the future, I plan on releasing something even bigger, so stay tuned!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tab-content" id="tab2">
            <h2>Coding & Development</h2>
            <p>I’ve been working on coding for as long as I can remember. My Roblox username is <strong>Zyraskk</strong>, and I’ve developed games, created scripts, and even got into some exploit scripting, though I only use my exploit for personal projects. I’m not about cheating, it’s about creativity.</p>
            <p>Currently, I’m into <strong>web development</strong>, learning new languages, and integrating coding with my gaming projects. I've been playing around with creating mods and scripting for Minecraft, and I've started to build out some new projects on Roblox using the latest technologies.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tab-content" id="tab3">
            <h2>Baking & Hobbies</h2>
            <p>Baking is a huge part of my life. When I'm not coding, I'm either trying out new recipes or baking for my friends and family. My go-to dessert is chocolate chip cookies, but I’ve also been known to bake some insane cakes.</p>
            <p>Aside from that, I love dogs! I have a few pets, and they keep me grounded. Whenever I take a break from the screen, I hang out with them and enjoy some downtime. Life’s all about balance, right?</p>
