            <p>Iâ€™m a 17-year-old developer, gamer, and creator with a love for coding games, making projects, and creating worlds. I enjoy the process of baking as much as I enjoy developing my latest Roblox game.</p>

                <p>Hey! Iâ€™m Zyrask, also known as Messiah in the real world. I'm 17 years old and a passionate developer with a deep interest in web development, coding games, and designing cool, immersive worlds in Roblox and Minecraft. My journey in coding started young and it just became a way of life.</p>
                <p>One of my favorite artists is Lil Uzi Vert, especially his older stuff like *"XO Tour Llif3"*â€”but I keep it real and stay away from mainstream tracks that get overhyped.</p>
                <p>I used to work at plenty of Roblox servers and have been a developer for several games, including my project *Mythical Clash*, which has since been privated. I've also got a few game exploits and scripts Iâ€™ve made, but donâ€™t get it twistedâ€”I'm all about coding for fun and learning, not cheating.</p>
                <p>When I'm not coding, youâ€™ll probably find me bakingâ€”whether it's cookies, cakes, or trying out new recipes. But seriously, I'm always learning and pushing myself to improve.</p>
                <p>By the way, I love dogs. They're just a whole vibe. ðŸ˜Ž</p>
