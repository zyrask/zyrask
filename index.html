    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm Messiah, better known online as Zyrask. I'm 17 years old and passionate about a wide range of things, from game development and coding to design, and even baking. I’ve worked on multiple Roblox games, crafted custom UIs, and developed unique game mechanics. I’ve had a fascination with the technical side of things ever since I was young, and that’s only grown over the years. Coding isn’t just a job for me; it's a way of life. It’s an outlet where I can express my creativity, solve complex problems, and continue pushing myself forward.</p>
        <p>When I’m not working on my projects, you can catch me playing games or baking something delicious in the kitchen. I’ve always been intrigued by the intersection of creativity and technology, and that’s exactly what I love about web development, game dev, and digital design. I believe in continuously improving and staying true to my unique style while always being open to learning new techniques and tools.</p>

        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <p>Below are some of the coolest projects I’ve worked on. While I’m constantly working on new ideas, these are some of the highlights from my journey:</p>

        <div class="tabs">
            <button class="tab-button active" data-target="mythical-clash">Mythical Clash (Roblox)</button>
            <button class="tab-button" data-target="randomizer-ui">Randomizer UI</button>
            <button class="tab-button" data-target="game-tool">Game Tool</button>
        </div>
        <div class="tab-content active" id="mythical-clash">
            <h3>Mythical Clash</h3>
            <p>Mythical Clash was a fighting game I developed on Roblox. It featured innovative mechanics and a deep combat system. The game was unique because of its ability to offer players a variety of mythical powers to choose from, each with its own set of challenges. While the game is now privated, it remains one of the proudest accomplishments of my early development career.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tab-content" id="randomizer-ui">
            <h3>Randomizer UI</h3>
            <p>Designed specifically for Roblox games, this user interface allows players to easily randomize game events, loot drops, and more. I created this as part of a toolset for game developers looking to add a fun, unpredictable element to their gameplay.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tab-content" id="game-tool">
            <h3>Game Tool</h3>
            <p>This tool was created to make game design easier for developers. It’s a utility that helps automate and randomize specific game settings, such as spawn points, enemy types, and weather patterns. It’s still in development, but I’m excited about its potential.</p>

        <p>Beyond coding and game development, I have a variety of interests and hobbies that I dive into when I’m looking to relax or just escape into something creative. Some of my top hobbies include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Gaming:</strong> I love playing games, whether it’s RPGs, action-adventure, or strategy games. My go-to platforms are Roblox, PC, and consoles.</li>
            <li><strong>Music:</strong> I’m big on music, especially rap. Lil Uzi Vert is one of my favorite artists, with his older tracks being my top picks. But I also enjoy exploring different genres of music.</li>

    <section id="vision">
        <h2>Vision for the Future</h2>
        <p>Looking ahead, I want to continue building the skills that have already helped me become a better developer and creator. But I also want to take on bigger challenges—projects that push me beyond my comfort zone and give me a chance to make something that others can enjoy and learn from.</p>
        <p>I want to work on more advanced games, enhance my knowledge of web development, and expand my network of fellow creators. I hope to collaborate on larger projects with teams, take on freelance work, and eventually even start my own development studio. But most importantly, I want to create experiences that inspire others to follow their own creative pursuits.</p>
