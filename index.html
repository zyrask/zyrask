            <h2>Hey, I'm Zyrask!</h2>
            <p>I'm a 17-year-old developer, gamer, and creator. My journey in tech and gaming has been nothing short of extraordinary. I make Roblox games, design epic Minecraft builds, and code unique projects. Outside of dev work, I enjoy experimenting in the kitchen with baking!</p>

    <!-- About Me -->
    <section id="about" class="section">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>From a young age, I’ve always been captivated by the digital world. Whether it was designing my first Minecraft structure or scripting my first game in Roblox, I was hooked. I began experimenting with coding at 12, and since then, it’s become my passion. I’ve built everything from multiplayer RPGs to complex in-game systems, constantly pushing my skills further.</p>
        <p>When I'm not creating, I'm usually tweaking a new recipe, baking cookies or cakes, or just gaming with friends. My work is a blend of creativity and technical precision, a balance that defines who I am as both a developer and a gamer.</p>

            <li>**Baking Bot AI** (AI Project)  
            An AI I coded to help guide new bakers through recipes, adjusting based on available ingredients. A fun side project that mixed coding with my love of baking!</li>
